4 key Principals that you should be ware of for the desing of large programs

1. Encapsulation
    - Restricting the direct access tosome of out attributes in a program.
2. Abstraction
    - You want to abstract the information that is unnecessary to call it or to access it.
3. Inheritance
    - Is a mechanism that allows us to reuse code across our classes.
4. Polymorphism (reefrs to many forms) poly = many / morphism = forms
    - It refers to use of a single type entity to represent different types in different scenarios.

Encapsulation of name:
# Setting an Attribute
item1.name = "Other"

# Getting an Attribute
print(item1.name)

Encapsulation of price:
# item1.price = 900

item1.apply_increment(0.2)
item1.apply_discount()

print(item1.price)
